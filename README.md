# Zhuhai Urban Functional Zone Classification

This project focuses on **urban functional zone classification** in Zhuhai, China, by integrating **remote sensing imagery, POI data, deep learning models, and a knowledge graph**.

## 🏙️ Project Background
Accurate identification of urban functional zones is essential for urban planning, land-use management, and smart city development. Traditional rule-based methods often struggle with complex urban patterns and multi-source data integration.

This project explores a **data-driven and knowledge-enhanced approach** for functional zone classification in rapidly urbanizing regions.

## 📊 Data Sources
- Remote sensing imagery
- POI (Point of Interest) data
- Socio-economic and auxiliary spatial data

Only **sample data** are included in this repository.

## 🧠 Methodology
The proposed framework consists of:

1. **Multi-source data preprocessing**
   - Remote sensing feature extraction
   - POI spatial aggregation
2. **Deep learning–based classification**
   - Neural networks for functional zone recognition
3. **Knowledge graph construction**
   - Functional zone taxonomy
   - Semantic relationships modeled using Neo4j
4. **Result refinement and evaluation**
   - Accuracy assessment
   - Spatial distribution analysis

## 🧩 Knowledge Graph
A domain-specific knowledge graph is constructed to enhance semantic consistency and interpretability of classification results.

## 🗺️ Outputs
- Urban functional zone maps of Zhuhai
- Classification accuracy evaluation
- Knowledge graph visualization
